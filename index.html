        <p>
          The City of Vancouver monitors how residents travel  whether by walking, cycling, or using public transit to understand our collective shift toward more sustainable modes of transportation.
          </p>
          <p>Tracking this data helps evaluate how effectively we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting citywide sustainability goals.
          </p>
          <p>Mode share is an important indicator in assessing the success of key strategies outlined in the Climate Emergency Action Plan and Transportation 2040 Plan. These initiatives aim to create a safer, cleaner, and more connected city by encouraging residents to choose active and low-carbon ways of getting around.</p>

        How We Measure It

      </button>
      <div class="accordian-body">
        <p>
          Our Engineering Services department conducts an annual Transportation Panel Survey recording the trips that respondents make using any mode of transportation. This indicator is based on all trips between two points, whether for work, school, shopping, socializing, or another purpose. It reports the percentage of these trips that are made by walking, 
          cycling, or public transit on a typical weekday.​

        What the Results Show
        <span class="arrow"></span>
      </button>
      <div class="accordian-body">
        <p>
          We met our 2020 sustainable mode share goal in 2015/16, and we’re working hard to meet our previous 2040 goal by 2030.
          </p>
          <p>Because of Covid-19, the sustainable mode share for all trips in 2020 is 44%, down from 54% in 2019 and below the 50% mode share target. This is because there were a significant number of trips that were not made, particularly with increased online learning and working remotely from home.
          </p>
          <p>In 2021 and beyond, we will continue creating strategies and prioritizing action to meet targets from our Climate Emergency Response.</p>
